## Hi there! 👋 Welcome on my GitHub Page!


I'm Manu - a CS student located in the metropolitan area of Munich, Germany.

<br>

### Some facts about me 🎯	
I love doing sports (lifting and swimming in particular), cooking (isn't cooking just the execution of an algorithm, at the end?) and travelling.<br> 
Additionally, as (probably) most other people here on that platform, I have an unhealthy relationship with coffee ☕ .

### How I got into programming 📖	
I started to teach myself programming by the end of 2017. Like many others, I was not quite sure what to do now after I had done my A-Levels. Basically, there were three things I was good at: **Sports**, **English** (or foreign languages generally) and **Computers**. 

After evaluating what's probably the most job-safe, interesting, useful and future-oriented area I had decided to look into something related to Computers, or something technical at least.

I never had much of an idea about technology or how it works but I always thought it's fascinating how it evolves so fast and, in particular, how diverse it is and how many possibilities it offers. So, the idea of looking into programming came up pretty quickly and thankfully there was still quite some time left until I had to make a decision.<br>
As I had no knowledge about programming whatsoever back then, I tried to find a way to learn something about it in order to make it easier for me to judge if it fits me.

Eventually I discovered the **Udemy Platform** and due to my interest in the **World Wide Web** and how it works (and how websites work in particular) I decided to buy a course teaching Web Development with **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**. I had so much fun and learned so much in this course that I had decided to study Computer Science afterwards.

So a short time after, I enrolled in a bachelor's degree program at the [University of Munich](https://www.lmu.de/de/index.html).  👨‍🎓
